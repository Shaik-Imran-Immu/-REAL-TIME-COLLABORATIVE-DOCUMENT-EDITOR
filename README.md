DESCRIPTION: [Task - 3]

Developed a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor, enabling multiple users to simultaneously edit and view documents with immediate synchronization across all connected clients. A responsive and dynamic web application that allows real-time collaboration, similar to tools like Google Docs or Notion. The application leverage modern frontend frameworks like React.js, a robust backend built with Node.js and a persistent database MongoDB for storing documents and user data.

Objective:
Built a full-stack, real-time document editing platform that demonstrates a seamless integration of frontend, backend, and database systems. The platform handle concurrent edits, ensure conflict resolution or synchronization and maintain data consistency across users in real time. The application is user-friendly, scalable and capable of handling collaborative editing sessions involving multiple participants.

Key Features:

1. Real-Time Collaboration:
   The core functionality involves enabling users to edit a document concurrently. Changes made by one user must be instantly visible to all other connected users. This is typically achieved using WebSockets, Socket.IO which support persistent connections and bi-directional data flow between the client and server.

2. Frontend Interface (React.js):
   The frontend is responsible for:

   * A live document editing area (e.g., text editor)
   * User presence indicators
   * Auto-save functionality
   * Responsive layout for mobile and desktop devices

3. Backend (Node.js):
   The backend is responsible for:

   * Managing document sessions and user authentication
   * Handling WebSocket connections and broadcasting changes
   * Ensuring synchronization and conflict resolution mechanisms
   * Communicating with the database to save and retrieve document versions

   Node.js with Socket.IO is a popular choice for real-time applications.

4. Database Integration (MongoDB):
   Persistent storage is essential for saving user documents, version history, and session data. MongoDB (NoSQL) is well-suited for flexible, document-based storage and real-time updates, it supports:

   * Document creation, retrieval and updates
   * Session tracking

6. Conflict Handling and Synchronization:
   Managing concurrent edits is a critical part of real-time collaboration. Depending on complexity, this is handled using:

   * Operational Transformation (OT)
   * Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
   * A simple last-write-wins approach for basic implementation

Deliverables:

* A functional real-time collaborative document editor accessible via a web browser.
* Frontend developed in React.js, featuring a responsive, intuitive UI.
* Backend server using Node.js, that manages user sessions, document changes and real-time data flow.
* Integration with MongoDB for persistent document storage.
* Clean, well-commented codebase with modular architecture.

Evaluation Criteria:

* Real-time editing capability and smooth synchronization
* Functional and intuitive user interface
* Seamless frontend-backend integration
* Proper storage and retrieval of documents
* Code quality, documentation, and responsiveness
